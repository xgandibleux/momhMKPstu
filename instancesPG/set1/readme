Instances of bi-objective bi-dimensional 01 knapsack problems (p=2 and m=2) 
generated/reformated by Olga Perederieieva and Xavier Gandibleux.


The problem to be solved is:
 Max  sum{j=1,...,n} p(k,j)x(j)                k=1,...,p
 st   sum{j=1,...,n} w(i,j)x(j) <= ω_{i}       i=1,...,m
                     x(j) = 0 or 1

Characteristics: 

6 instances of various sizes, randomly generated with the same generator, without any specific correlation. 

ZL100, ZL250, ZL500 and ZL750 are 4 instances picked from the collection maintained by Zitzler and Laumanns (originally named respectively knapsack.100.2 knapsack.250.2 knapsack.500.2 and knapsack.750.2). 

ZL28 and ZL105 are 2 additional instances derived respectively from ZL100 (knapsack.100.2) and ZL250 (knapsack.250.2), where 

  ω_{i} ≈ 0.5 \sum_{j=1}^{n} 􏰆w_{i,j}, i = 1,...,m. 

The number following ZL in the name gives the number of variables.


Format: 

The format of these data files is:
  number of variables (n) 
  the constraint right-hand side ω_{1}
  the constraint right-hand side ω_{2}
  for each variable j (j=1,...,n) the coefficients:
    p(1,j) p(2,j)   w(1,j) w(2,j)
