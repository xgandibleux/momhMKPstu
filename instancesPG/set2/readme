Instances of bi-objective bi-dimensional 01 knapsack problems (p=2 and m=2) 
generated/reformated by Olga Perederieieva and Xavier Gandibleux.


The problem to be solved is:
 Max  sum{j=1,...,n} p(k,j)x(j)                k=1,...,p
 st   sum{j=1,...,n} w(i,j)x(j) <= ω_{i}       i=1,...,m
                     x(j) = 0 or 1

Characteristics: 

15 correlated instances with 28 variables, introduced by Perederieieva (2011). 

A1, A2, A3, A4, D1, D2, D3, D4, kp28W-ZL, kp28, kp28-2, kp28W, kp28W-Perm, kp28c1W-c2ZL and kp28cW-WZL are extention of 01BKP instances available on the OR-library where a second objective has been added with respect to several definitions of correlation to obtain a Bi-01BKP instance. 

The second objective of kp28W-Perm is a permutation of the coefficients of the first objective function. 

The second objective function is not correlated to the first objective function, neither the constraints for the instances kp28W-ZL, kp28, kp28-2, kp28W, kp28c1W-c2ZL. 

For the other instances, the second objective is correlated with the first one. 

Further details are given in (Perederieieva, 2011).


Format: 

The format of these data files is:
  number of variables (n) 
  the constraint right-hand side ω_{1}
  the constraint right-hand side ω_{2}
  for each variable j (j=1,...,n) the coefficients:
    p(1,j) p(2,j)   w(1,j) w(2,j)
